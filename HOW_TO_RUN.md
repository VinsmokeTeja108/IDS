## üì¶ Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download/Clone the Project

If you have the project folder, navigate to it:

```bash
cd path/to/IDS
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

Install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Expected packages:**
- scapy
- flask
- flask-socketio
- flask-cors
- pyyaml
- python-socketio

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Check if packages are installed:

```bash
pip list
```

Look for the packages listed above.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Step 1: Copy Example Configuration

If `config.yaml` doesn't exist, copy from example:

```bash
# Windows
copy config.yaml.example config.yaml

# Linux/Mac
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

### Step 2: Find Your Network Interface

**Windows:**
```cmd
ipconfig
```
Look for your active adapter name (e.g., "Wi-Fi", "Ethernet")

**Linux:**
```bash
ifconfig
# or
ip addr show
```
Look for your interface name (e.g., "eth0", "wlan0")

**macOS:**
```bash
ifconfig
```
Look for your interface name (e.g., "en0", "en1")

### Step 3: Edit Configuration File

Open `config.yaml` in a text editor and update:

```yaml
detection:
  network_interface: YOUR_INTERFACE_NAME  # Replace with your interface
```

### Step 4: Configure Email (Optional)

If you want email notifications, update the email section:

```yaml
email:
  smtp_host: smtp.gmail.com
  smtp_port: 587
  use_tls: true
  username: your-email@gmail.com
  password: your-app-password
  recipients:
    - recipient1@example.com
    - recipient2@example.com
```

**For Gmail:**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
2. Go to: Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí App Passwords
3. Generate an app password
4. Use that password in the config file

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission Denied" Error

**Solution:**
- Windows: Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Linux/Mac: Use `sudo` before the command

### Issue: "Network Interface Not Found"

**Solution:**
1. Check your interface name using `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/Mac)
2. Update `config.yaml` with the correct interface name
3. Restart the IDS

### Issue: Web Page Won't Load

**Solution:**
1. Check if the IDS is running (look for "Running on http://..." message)
2. Try `http://127.0.0.1:5000` instead of `localhost`
3. Check if port 5000 is already in use
4. Try a different browser

### Issue: "WebSocket Disconnected"

**Solution:**
1. Check if the IDS is still running in the terminal
2. Refresh the web page (F5)
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Issue: No Threats Detected

**Possible Reasons:**
1. Network interface is not receiving traffic
2. Detection thresholds are too high
3. No actual threats on the network (this is good!)

**To Test:**
- Lower detection thresholds in Configuration
- Generate test traffic (e.g., port scan with nmap)
- Check logs for any errors

### Issue: Email Notifications Not Working

**Solution:**
1. Verify SMTP settings in `config.yaml`
2. For Gmail, ensure you're using an App Password (not your regular password)
3. Check if 2-Factor Authentication is enabled
4. Use "Test Email" button in Configuration page
5. Check `ids.log` for email errors

### Issue: High CPU Usage

**Solution:**
1. This is normal during active packet capture
2. Reduce detection thresholds if too many false positives
3. Stop monitoring when not needed
4. Close other resource-intensive applications

### Issue: Python Package Import Errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinstall all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Or install individually
pip install scapy flask flask-socketio flask-cors pyyaml python-socketio
```

### Issue: Port 5000 Already in Use

**Solution:**
1. Find what's using port 5000:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :5000
   
   # Linux/Mac
   lsof -i :5000
   ```
2. Stop that process or modify `run_ids_with_ui.py` to use a different port

## üõë Stopping the System

### Graceful Shutdown

1. In the web interface, click "Stop Monitoring"
2. In the terminal/command prompt, press `Ctrl + C`
3. Wait for the system to shut down gracefully

### Force Stop (if needed)

**Windows:**
- Press `Ctrl + C` in the command prompt
- If that doesn't work, close the command prompt window

**Linux/Mac:**
- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
- If that doesn't work, press `Ctrl + Z` then type `kill %1`

## üìä Monitoring Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Start with Default Settings**: Use default thresholds initially
2. **Monitor Regularly**: Check the dashboard periodically
3. **Review Analytics**: Look for patterns in the Analytics page
4. **Adjust Thresholds**: Fine-tune based on your network
5. **Check Logs**: Review logs for any issues
6. **Test Email**: Verify email notifications work before relying on them

### Performance Tips

1. **Close Unused Applications**: Free up system resources
2. **Use Wired Connection**: More stable than Wi-Fi for monitoring
3. **Monitor During Peak Hours**: Capture more traffic
4. **Regular Restarts**: Restart the IDS daily for optimal performance

### Security Tips

1. **Keep Config Secure**: Don't share `config.yaml` with credentials
2. **Use Strong Passwords**: For email accounts
3. **Monitor Authorized Networks Only**: Ensure you have permission
4. **Review Threats Regularly**: Don't ignore alerts
5. **Update Regularly**: Keep Python and packages updated
