# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic and system activities to identify potential security threats. The system will detect various types of attacks including malware, network scans, ICMP scans, and other cybersecurity threats. Upon detection, the system will automatically send email notifications to the system owner with detailed information about the threat, its severity level, and recommended remediation steps.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Threat Detection

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the IDS to detect various types of security threats in real-time, so that I can be immediately aware of potential attacks on my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network traffic is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify potential attacker IP addresses based on suspicious patterns
2. WHEN file system activity is monitored THEN the system SHALL detect malware signatures and suspicious file operations
3. WHEN network packets are captured THEN the system SHALL identify port scanning attempts (TCP/UDP scans)
4. WHEN ICMP packets are analyzed THEN the system SHALL detect ICMP scan/ping sweep activities
5. WHEN multiple failed authentication attempts occur THEN the system SHALL flag potential brute force attacks
6. WHEN unusual outbound connections are detected THEN the system SHALL identify potential data exfiltration attempts

### Requirement 2: Threat Classification and Severity Assessment

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want each detected threat to be classified and assigned a severity level, so that I can prioritize my response based on the risk level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a threat is detected THEN the system SHALL classify it into one of the following categories: attacker identification, malware detection, network scan, ICMP scan, brute force, or data exfiltration
2. WHEN a threat is classified THEN the system SHALL assign a severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on predefined criteria
3. IF multiple threats are detected from the same source THEN the system SHALL escalate the severity level accordingly
4. WHEN severity is assigned THEN the system SHALL include justification for the severity rating

### Requirement 3: Email Notification System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to receive email notifications when threats are detected, so that I can take immediate action even when I'm not actively monitoring the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a threat is detected THEN the system SHALL send an email notification to the configured owner email address
2. WHEN an email is sent THEN it SHALL include the threat type in the subject line
3. WHEN an email is sent THEN the message body SHALL contain the threat classification, severity level, timestamp, and source information
4. WHEN an email is sent THEN it SHALL include recommended fixes and solutions specific to the detected threat type
5. IF the email fails to send THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry up to 3 times
6. WHEN multiple threats are detected within a short time window THEN the system SHALL batch notifications to avoid email flooding

### Requirement 4: Threat Analysis and Recommendations

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to receive actionable recommendations for each detected threat, so that I can quickly remediate security issues without extensive research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a threat is detected THEN the system SHALL generate specific remediation recommendations based on the threat type
2. WHEN recommendations are provided THEN they SHALL include immediate actions (e.g., block IP, quarantine file)
3. WHEN recommendations are provided THEN they SHALL include preventive measures to avoid similar threats in the future
4. WHEN an attacker IP is identified THEN the system SHALL recommend firewall rules or IP blocking strategies
5. WHEN malware is detected THEN the system SHALL recommend file quarantine, system scan, and signature updates
6. WHEN network scans are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend port closure and network segmentation strategies

### Requirement 5: System Configuration and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the IDS settings including email recipients and detection thresholds, so that the system can be customized to my environment's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL load configuration from a configuration file
2. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL include email server settings (SMTP host, port, credentials)
3. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL include recipient email addresses
4. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL include detection thresholds and sensitivity levels
5. IF configuration is invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL use secure defaults and log a warning
6. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL reload settings without requiring a restart

### Requirement 6: Logging and Audit Trail

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all detected threats and system actions to be logged, so that I can perform forensic analysis and maintain compliance records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a threat is detected THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp, threat type, severity, and source details
2. WHEN an email notification is sent THEN the system SHALL log the notification status
3. WHEN the system starts or stops THEN it SHALL log the event with timestamp
4. WHEN logs are written THEN they SHALL be stored in a structured format (JSON or similar)
5. WHEN log files reach a size threshold THEN the system SHALL rotate logs to prevent disk space issues
6. WHEN logs are accessed THEN they SHALL be readable by standard log analysis tools

### Requirement 7: Network Traffic Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the IDS to monitor network traffic in real-time, so that network-based threats can be detected as they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL begin capturing network packets on configured interfaces
2. WHEN packets are captured THEN the system SHALL analyze packet headers and payloads for threat indicators
3. WHEN network monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL operate with minimal performance impact on the host system
4. IF packet capture fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt to reinitialize
5. WHEN suspicious patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL extract relevant metadata (source IP, destination port, protocol)
