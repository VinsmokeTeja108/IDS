# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive web-based user interface for the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The UI will provide system administrators with complete access to all IDS features including network monitoring, threat detection, email notifications management, configuration settings, logging, and real-time analytics. The interface will display all detection results with clear severity indicators, provide detailed threat information, and allow full system management through an intuitive web interface.

## Requirements
